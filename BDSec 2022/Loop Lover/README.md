# Loop Lover
This challenge was part of BDSec CTF 2022. This is my 2nd ever live CTF, so I'm pretty bad at this kind of stuff. Anyways, the challenge I want to write about it Loop Lover. It's a pretty easy challenge at 100 points, but it was the one I enjoyed solving the most.

## The Challenge
The description read as follows:

> Loops are fun. Are they?

It came with two attached files, `ciphertext.py` and `enc.py`:
```
kU1HlnN1aQMBNNRDzX20M73X9RwUTRz9
```
```python
def f(t):
    c = list(t)
    for i in range(len(t)):
        for j in range(i, len(t) - 1):
            for k in range(j, len(t) - 2):
                c[k], c[k+1] = c[k+1], c[k]
    return "".join(c)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    flag = open("flag.txt", "r").read()
    open("ciphertext.txt", "w").write(f(flag))
```
Essentially, what this does is do a bunch of random loops then performs some weird array assignments and joins them all together. Every single "hard" crypto challenge I've done before this (which in total is probably less than 5) included bitwise operations, so I was a bit surprised.

I didn't have any clue how to start, so I just pushed it aside as too hard and went to a different one. However, when I came back, I more closely examined the `c[k], c[k+1] = c[k+1], c[k]` part, and tried in the python REPL â€” and it just swaps two adjacent array elements. This was very helpful, and I imagined the problem as [the game where you track the ball under the cup](https://youtu.be/9bto_3Z1dqc) (sorry for explaining it poorly).

Anyways, there is one key property that I noticed. First, the value of each letter of the input didn't matter. This got me to run a test where I ran a 33 (length of `ciphertext.txt`) sized flag with all unique characters and noted where the different characters went. I then made a dictionary of mapping from output to input, and applying that to the `ciphertext.txt` I got this:
```
QkRTRUN7anU1N19MMDBwX20zXzR3NHl9
```
From here I just threw it in [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) (such a handy tool for a lazy person like me) and turns out it was a base64 encoded string with the flag:
```
BDSEC{ju57_L00p_m3_4w4y}
```
Thank you for reading my n3wby self explain my thought process about this challenge, and I suppose if you had to take one lesson out of this it's to not over-complicate things. Or do, I'm not your teacher.
